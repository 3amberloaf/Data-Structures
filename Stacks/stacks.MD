# Stack

A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the LAST-IN-LAST-OUT principle. It runs in O(1) time complexity and takes up O(n) space.

## Main Stack Operations

1. Init():  Initializes the stack to empty.
2. push(e): inserts an element, e.
3. pop(): removes the last inserted element; leaves the stack unchanged if it is empty.

## Auxilliary Operations

1. top(): returns the last inserted element without removing it.  Error message if stack is empty.
2. size(): returns the number of elements stored
3. isEmpty(): indicates whether no elements are stored
